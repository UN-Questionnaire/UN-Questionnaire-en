*Experimental status*
#### Introduction

The Ultra-efficient Neuroscientific Questionnaire is a screening instrument for assessing psychological constructs on various time-scales (short-term states to long-term traits). It aims to be widely applicable and the most comprehensive, most efficient and most accessible psychological general screening instrument for clinical and sub-clinical applications.

The UN-Q has an explorative focus and ought to be used in the context of neuro-psychological research or therapies. It aims to provide a general overview on the psychological condition of an individual, including physical/bodily health. It provides unlimited repeated-continuous measurements and instantaneous visual result displays, including automatic threshold notifications. (A paper version might be released, but this would miss the point.) The efficacy and broadness of the UN-Q is maximized by exploring the theoretic minimum of the number of items per domain, leading to a mostly one-to-one relationship between items and constructs. 


A complete, initial assessment is targeted to take less than 15 minutes with subsequent assessments taking between 1 to 2 minutes. (
In the future, many items will be discarded as a  sufficient sample size will reached to allow further analysis and validation of items.)



















#### Early Testing Status
The questionnaire is in experimental status and is not yet validated. Though its item selection is similar to validated questionnaires, it contains many experimental constructs and items and should therefor be *interpreted with caution*.







## Previewing the Questionnaire
A preview version is available to prevent low-quality data in the real assessments and to allow clicking-through the instrument. The questions are not mandatory, not randomized and prefilled for feedback displays.

#### Note for individuals (self-assessment)
Save the randomized session code / url at a secure place to allow retesting at a later point in time and to be able to compare results. 
#### Note for mobile users 
It is recommended to use the screen vertically. Printing / downloading results as pdf is disabled by Android.
       	

#### Note for practitioners
To use the questionnaire with multiple patients, practitioners have to, for now, save the provided randomized session codes / url's in an own spreadsheet with own patient identifiers. Individual sessions can then be accessed with the saved session codes.





       	
     
     
#### Session key and privacy
The generated session key / url is the only way to access a single run und must be stored to access a run again. A single session cookie is temporarily stored during a session on one device/browser. 
No personal-sensible information are assessed and no data is/will be shared with third parties. Data is only used to validate and normate the questionnaire.

### Test Design



The questionnaire was designed eclectically (non-theory driven) initially to discover neurophysiological correlates / biomarkers. 


The UN-Q is inspired by an [in-depth comparison of about 60 clinical questionnaires](https://github.com/UN-Questionnaire/Comparison-of-Psychological-Clinical-Instruments). Most instruments have been proven to be useful in practice, though certain questionnaires amongst others stood out in terms of either efficiency or generality and had a major influence on the construction of this questionnaire: The American Psyciatric Association DSM-5 CC Symptoms (also available as online versions in [English](https://github.com/UN-Questionnaire/DSM-5-Crosscutting-Symptoms-en) and [German](https://github.com/UN-Questionnaire/DSM-5-Crosscutting-Symptoms-de), Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ, the Affective Scale AS-2, Big-Five-Inventory BFI-10. The Life-Satisfaction Item L-1 along with Terman's Happyness Item in particular *'How happy are you?'*, which dates back to the 1930s and is said to *'explain more variance than all other items combined'*, had been an inspiration for the creation of this explorative questionnaire and to investigate the limits of language-based instruments. 




#### Currently not included:
- Interpretation and theoretic background of each measured construct (due to the large number of constructs)


- Analysis of item quality and usefulness (will be done with a large enough sample size) and adding colored histograms/gaussian curves to the feedback displays f.i. classified by symptom strength 
- Post-therapy and therapy satisfaction questionnaire
 - Large collection of highly experimental custom items for biomarker discovery
 (f.i. egg consumption for tryptophan intake)  
## Dependencies

Created with formR. FormR is a software framework based on R for the creation of psychological questionnaires. It was developed by Ruben Arslan at the University Goettingen and is under active development, therefor it can sometimes not be available during software changes. It is an incredibly conscientious and dedicated project that made this project even possible. 
## Feedback and Bugs
